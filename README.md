Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a game developemnt company behind the popular mobile game Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to develop a successor game named Win, Lose, or Draw. This game needs to be accessible from multiple platforms that only allows for a single instance of the game to be opened at once. There will be multiple teams of multiple players allowed.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that my analysis of each of the platforms when dealing with comparing their Server Side untilities, Client Side and Development tools was in depth and accurate. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Using a design document to help develop code allowed me to more easily organize and clarify the requirements of the client. This allowed me to be more efficient with my coding as well as making the proper decision when choosing which server platform to use.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Personally I would revise my recommendations as I believe that given more time and resources to practice with and conduct research on each of the systems I would be able to give a much more refined recommendation.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When taking a look at the requirements set by the user's, taking each into consideration this helped me to figure out what exact the code needs to be performing. When designing, the user's needs being met are what determines if a project is finished or not. One need from one user and a nother from a different user could change how a program needs to function entirely.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
